## Scala GitHub History

With almost 30k commits and a history spanning over ten years, Scala is a mature programming language. It is a general-purpose programming language that has recently become another prominent language for data scientists.

Scala is also an open source project. Open source projects have the advantage that their entire development histories -- who made changes, what was changed, code reviews, etc. -- are publicly available.

I went through reading in, cleaning up, and visualizing the real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub). In order to find out who has had the most influence on its development and who are the experts.
